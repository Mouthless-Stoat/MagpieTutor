## Draft Command ##

### Argument ###
- `set`: Which set you want to draft from (You cannot choose multiple set)
- `size`: The final deck side or how many pack you want to open
- Option for excluding certain cost. Free card will still appear:
    - `beast`: remove all cards that cost blood from the draft pool
    - `undead`: remove all cards that cost blood from the draft pool
    - `tech`: remove all cards that cost blood from the draft pool
    - `magick`: remove all cards that cost blood from the draft pool. This will also remove all the cards that support magic

### How to use ###
- You cannot undo selection. 
- Once you have 4 of the same common and try to take a fifth you will receive a Wild instead 
- Wild can be use to trade in any common card
- Once you exhaust the list of rare in the draft pool you will not get any more rare
